# Women in the Olympic

## Description

Pierre DE Coubertin, founder of the modern games, strongly opposed the idea of women participating in the games, calling it "unrealistic, boring, unaesthetic and incorrect".
While he was not the last person to oppose women's participation in the games. Many people questioned whether women should take part in the games. After all, some sports are too hard for women, such as shot put or long-distance running.
Here, I wanted to understand the historical trend of medals won by women athletes in Olympics: how many medals did women win in the winter Olympic, what the proportion of medals won by women on Olympic teams, and what is the trend.The data what I discover is set contains 5,771 pieces of information about 1924 to 2014 winter Olympics.

Built with Python 3.

## Steps:
1. Sort the data , filter by values to women only
2. Get statistics on how many women won medals each year, and make a visual line chart
3. Get statistics on how many men won medals each year, and make a visual bar chart to compare the number of medals won by women and men
4. Make a pie chart for the most recently winter Olympic (2014) medals proportion
